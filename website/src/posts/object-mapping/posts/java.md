Java classes are different from those of Kotlin. The main difference for Mappie is that Java does not have the concept
of properties. Instead, the convention is to have a field `x`, and a getter `getX()` and setter `setX(Person value)`
method. 

Mappie uses these getter- and setter methods in implicit mappings. They must follow the convention `getX()` and 
`setX(...)` for the property `x` to be inferred. Java records do not follow this convention. They are also supported, 
and its generated getters are inferred.

Also note that in Java all types are nullable. Mappie will give a warning if a Java type is used to assign to a 
non-nullable target. The Kotlin compiler uses several nullability annotations to determine whether the platform type 
is nullable or not. See for more information [Nullability annotations](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-interop.html#nullability-annotations).
These warnings can be disabled globally with the `strictplatformTypeNullability` configuration option or locally by
adding `@UseStrictPlatformTypeNullabilityValidation(false)` to the mapper.

For example, suppose we have the Java class `Person`
```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```
with the Kotlin data class `PersonDto`
```kotlin
data class PersonDto(val name: String)
```
We can write a mapper in a regular manner
```kotlin
class PersonMapper : ObjectMappie<Person, PersonDto>()
```
Mappie will infer that `Person` has the source property `name` and maps it to the target property `name` of `PersonDto`.

Do note that, by default, Java classes have public no-arg constructors. This means that a mapping can always be 
constructed without any explicit mappings.
