## Compatibility

Mappie depends on compiler internals, which are unstable. To overcome compilation errors, Mappie is tightly coupled
with the Kotlin version. The Mappie versioning scheme includes the Kotlin version. For example, `2.1.20-1.2.0` is 
compatible with Kotlin version `2.1.20` and the actual Mappie version is `1.2.0`.
