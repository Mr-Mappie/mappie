# How to contribute
Mappie welcomes pull requests from contributors!

Please file a PR from a forked repository to the `main` branch. Ideally, a PR
should fix a single issue and should be self-contained. Please refer to this issue in the PR. 
Each PR is expected to pass the workflows, and include test cases relevant for the issue.

If any help is needed, feel free to tag @stefankoppier in your PR,
or start a General discussion with your question.
